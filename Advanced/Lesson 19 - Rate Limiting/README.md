# Rate Limiting: A Core Concept in System Design

## 1. What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is a critical technique used to control the amount of incoming or outgoing traffic to or from a system, service, or API. By setting a cap on how many requests a user or client can make within a specific time frame, rate limiting ensures that shared resources are not overwhelmed.

It acts like a bouncer at a popular club: it lets people in at a manageable pace to ensure the club doesn't get too crowded, providing a better and safer experience for everyone inside.

## 2. Why is Rate Limiting Important?

Implementing rate limiting is essential for building robust, scalable, and secure systems.

- **Prevent System Overload:** It acts as a primary defense against traffic spikes (both legitimate and malicious), ensuring your backend services, databases, and infrastructure remain stable and responsive.
- **Ensure Fairness:** It provides equitable access to a shared resource by preventing any single user or client from monopolizing it. This guarantees a consistent quality of service for all users.
- **Protect Against Abuse:** It is a powerful tool to mitigate security threats like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, brute-force password attempts, and content scraping by malicious bots.
- **Manage Costs:** For services that rely on paid third-party APIs or have usage-based billing (e.g., cloud functions, data transfer), rate limiting directly controls operational costs by preventing runaway usage.

## 3. Common Rate Limiting Algorithms (Summary)

There are several popular algorithms for implementing rate limiting, each with its own trade-offs between performance, memory usage, and accuracy.

#### Token Bucket

- **Analogy:** A bucket holds a set number of tokens. Each incoming request must take one token to be processed. The bucket is refilled with new tokens at a fixed rate.
- **Behavior:** Allows for **bursts** of traffic. As long as there are tokens in the bucket, requests can be processed rapidly, up to the bucket's capacity. If the bucket is empty, new requests are rejected until tokens are refilled.

#### Leaky Bucket

- **Analogy:** Incoming requests are added to a bucket (a queue). The bucket "leaks" (processes requests) at a constant, fixed rate, regardless of how many requests are in it.
- **Behavior:** **Smooths out** traffic into a steady, constant stream. It does not allow for bursts. If the bucket becomes full, new requests are rejected (overflow).

#### Fixed Window Counter

- **Analogy:** A simple counter is maintained for a time window (e.g., "per hour"). The counter is incremented for each request.
- **Behavior:** It's easy to implement but can be imprecise. A burst of traffic at the edge of two windows (e.g., at `59:59` and `00:01`) can allow more requests than intended in a short period.

#### Sliding Window Log

- **Analogy:** Keep a log (e.g., a sorted set) of the timestamps of all recent requests. To check the limit, count how many timestamps fall within the current sliding window.
- **Behavior:** **Perfectly accurate**. It correctly enforces the rate limit over a moving time frame. However, it can consume a lot of memory to store all the timestamps.

#### Sliding Window Counter

- **Analogy:** A hybrid approach that approximates the accuracy of the Sliding Window Log without the high memory cost. It uses a counter for the current window and a weighted value from the previous window.
- **Behavior:** Provides a **good balance** between the simplicity of the Fixed Window and the accuracy of the Sliding Window Log. It's often the preferred choice for large-scale systems.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Bucket**           | Allows for bursts, flexible.                     | Can be more complex to implement than fixed window.       | APIs where clients may need to send a burst of requests occasionally.        |
| **Leaky Bucket**           | Smooths traffic, provides a stable outflow rate. | Bursts are not allowed, which may not suit all use cases. | Throttling network traffic or processing jobs from a queue at a steady pace. |
| **Fixed Window**           | Simple to implement, low memory usage.           | Allows for surges at the window boundaries.               | Basic rate limiting where perfect accuracy is not critical.                  |
| **Sliding Window Log**     | Perfectly accurate, no boundary issues.          | High memory and computational cost.                       | Scenarios requiring absolute precision where the traffic volume is low.      |
| **Sliding Window Counter** | Good balance of accuracy and performance.        | More complex than a fixed window.                         | High-performance, large-scale systems (e.g., major API providers).           |
