## Key Concepts

Some of the foundational components of the internet.

- **Clients and Servers**

  - **Clients**: Devices that request resources. These are typically the end-user's applications, like a web browser or a mobile app.
  - **Servers**: Powerful computers that store and provide resources (like webpages, images, or data) to clients upon request.

- **Protocols**

  - The set of rules that define how data is formatted and transmitted over the internet. They ensure that different devices can understand each other.
  - _Examples_: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `TCP/IP`.

- **IP Addresses (Internet Protocol Address)**

  - A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**
  - Often called the "phonebook of the internet." It's a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses.

## The Request-Response Cycle

The **Request-Response Cycle** is the fundamental communication process between a client and a server. It's how resources like webpages, images, and data are requested and delivered across the web.

### Steps in the Cycle

1.  **Client Sends a Request**: The user initiates a request, for example, by typing a URL into a browser or clicking a link. The browser constructs an HTTP request.

2.  **DNS Resolution**: The browser needs the server's IP address to send the request. It performs a DNS lookup to translate the domain name into an IP address. (See the [detailed DNS breakdown below](#the-dns-resolution-process-step-by-step)).

3.  **Establishing a Connection**: The client establishes a TCP connection with the server at the resolved IP address using the **three-way handshake** (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`). For secure communication, an additional TLS/SSL handshake occurs to establish an `HTTPS` connection.

4.  **Server Receives and Processes the Request**: The server receives the HTTP request, parses it to understand what is being asked for (e.g., a specific HTML file, data from an API), and processes it accordingly.

5.  **Server Sends a Response**: After processing, the server constructs an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and the requested resource (the "body").

6.  **Client Receives and Renders the Response**: The browser receives the response. It parses the HTML to build the page structure (DOM), processes CSS for styling, and executes JavaScript for interactivity, finally rendering the visible webpage for the user.

### HTTP Request Components

An HTTP request sent from the client consists of:

- **Method**: The action to be performed (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
- **Path**: The URL of the resource being requested.
- **HTTP Version**: The version of the protocol (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`).
- **Headers**: Metadata about the request (e.g., browser type, accepted formats).
- **Body (Optional)**: The data being sent to the server, used with methods like `POST`.

### HTTP Response Components

An HTTP response sent from the server consists of:

- **HTTP Version**: The version of the protocol.
- **Status Code**: A 3-digit code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., `200 OK`).
- **Headers**: Metadata about the response (e.g., content type, caching rules).
- **Body (Optional)**: The actual resource requested (e.g., HTML, CSS, JSON data).

### HTTP Methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action for a given resource.

- `GET`: Retrieves a resource from the server.
- `POST`: Submits data to the server to create a new resource.
- `PUT`: Updates an existing resource on the server by completely replacing it.
- `PATCH`: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
- `DELETE`: Deletes a specified resource.

### HTTP Status Codes

Status codes are grouped into five classes:

- `1xx` **Informational**: The request was received, continuing process.
- `2xx` **Successful**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- `3xx` **Redirection**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
- `4xx` **Client Error**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- `5xx` **Server Error**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

**Important Status Codes and Examples:**

| Code                            | Meaning                 | When to Use / Example                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`200 OK`**                    | Success                 | Standard response for a successful `GET` request, like fetching a webpage.          |
| **`201 Created`**               | Resource Created        | Returned after a `POST` request successfully creates a resource (e.g., a new user). |
| **`301 Moved Permanently`**     | Permanent Redirect      | When a page has moved to a new URL permanently. SEO-friendly.                       |
| **`400 Bad Request`**           | Client Error            | The server can't process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed JSON).  |
| **`401 Unauthorized`**          | Authentication Required | Accessing a protected route without providing valid credentials (e.g., API key).    |
| **`403 Forbidden`**             | Access Denied           | You are authenticated, but you don't have permission to access the resource.        |
| **`404 Not Found`**             | Resource Not Found      | The server cannot find the requested resource (e.g., a broken link).                |
| **`500 Internal Server Error`** | Server Error            | A generic "catch-all" error when the server encounters an unexpected condition.     |

### HTTP Headers

Headers provide crucial metadata for both the request and response.

- **Request Headers**:
  - `Host`: The domain name of the server.
  - `User-Agent`: Information about the client (e.g., browser, OS).
  - `Accept`: The media types the client can understand (e.g., `application/json`).
  - `Authorization`: Authentication credentials for the resource.
- **Response Headers**:
  - `Content-Type`: The media type of the returned content (e.g., `text/html`).
  - `Content-Length`: The size of the response body in bytes.
  - `Set-Cookie`: Sends a cookie from the server to the client.
  - `Cache-Control`: Directives for caching mechanisms.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Accessing a Webpage**: Your browser sends a `GET` request to a server's URL. The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Submitting a Form**: When you fill out a login or contact form and click "Submit," the browser sends a `POST` request containing the form data in its body.
- **API Calls**: Modern web applications (Single-Page Apps) use JavaScript to make API calls in the background. For example, a weather app sends a `GET` request to a weather API to fetch the latest forecast data, which is often returned as JSON.

### Best Practices

- **Optimize Requests**: Minimize the size and number of requests. Use techniques like image compression, file minification, and browser caching to speed up load times.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: A client application should be designed to handle non-200 responses. For example, if an API returns `404 Not Found`, the app should display a "user not found" message instead of crashing.
- **Secure Communications**: Always use `HTTPS` to encrypt the data exchanged between the client and server, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
