# 📂 Working with Directories in Go

Go's `os` package provides essential functions for creating, reading, changing, and removing directories, enabling efficient file system operations.

## 🛠️ Key Functions

### 📁 Creating Directories

- `os.Mkdir(name, perm)`  
  Creates a single directory with specified permissions.

- `os.MkdirAll(path, perm)`  
  Creates a directory along with any necessary parent directories. Useful for nested paths.

### 📄 Reading Directories

- `os.ReadDir(name)`  
  Reads the contents of a directory and returns a slice of `os.DirEntry` objects representing files and subdirectories.

### 🔄 Navigating Directories

- `os.Chdir(dir)`  
  Changes the current working directory.

### ❌ Removing Directories

- `os.Remove(name)`  
  Removes a file or (empty) directory.

- `os.RemoveAll(path)`  
  Removes a path and any children it contains. Useful for cleaning up directories recursively.

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Error Handling**  
  Always check for and handle errors returned by OS operations to avoid unexpected behavior.

- **Permissions**  
  Use appropriate permissions when creating directories (`0755` is commonly used for readable/executable by all and writable by owner).

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Use `filepath.Join` and `os` package functions to maintain compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🔧 Practical Applications

- **Organizing Files**  
  Automatically create and manage folder structures for storing application data.

- **File System Navigation**  
  Dynamically change and read directories based on user input or configuration.

- **Batch Processing**  
  Iterate through files in directories for processing (e.g., log analysis, image processing, etc.).

> 💡 Tip: Combine the `os` package with `path/filepath` for robust and platform-independent path management.
