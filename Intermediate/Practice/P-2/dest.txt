Content testing is a research method that helps understand if users can find and understand your content. With content testing, you can check if the content you create resonates with users, speaks directly to their pain points, and provides enough context to help users complete tasks successfully.
Content testing helps identify areas where your content might be unclear, confusing, or difficult to navigate, leading to a better user experience.
By understanding what resonates with your audience, you can create more engaging and effective content that keeps users interested and encourages them to take action.
