# Base64 Coding

## What is Encoding?

Encoding is a method used to translate data from its original format into a specific format that can be used by other systems, applications, or protocols.  
This translation ensures that data can be correctly interpreted and utilized across different environments.

## Why is Encoding Important?

- **Data Storage** – Ensures efficient and safe storage of information.
- **Data Transmission** – Allows reliable transfer of data across networks.
- **Data Interoperability** – Enables different systems to interpret data consistently.

## Common Examples of Data Encoding

### 1. Text Encoding

- **ASCII**  
  Uses 7 bits to represent text, mainly for English characters.

- **UTF-8**  
  Widely used for electronic communication. Can represent any character in the Unicode standard and is backward compatible with ASCII.

- **UTF-16**  
  Supports all Unicode characters using one or two 16-bit code units.

### 2. Data Encoding

- **Base64**  
  A method for encoding binary data into a text format using a set of 64 characters. Commonly used in email, data URIs, and cryptographic systems.

- **URL Encoding**  
  Converts characters into a format that can be safely transmitted over the internet by replacing unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.

### 3. File Encoding

- **Binary Encoding**  
  Represents data in its binary form, used for executable files, images, and videos.

- **Text Encoding**  
  Applies to files containing text, using encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16 to preserve the character data correctly.

## About Base64

Base64 is one of the most widely used encoding schemes for converting binary data into ASCII string format. This is especially useful when data needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with text, such as JSON or XML.

### Use Cases

- Embedding images or files in HTML or CSS
- Storing complex data in cookies or web storage
- Safely transmitting binary content via email or APIs
